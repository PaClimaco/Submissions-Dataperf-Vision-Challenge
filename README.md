# Submissions-DataPerf-Vision-Challenge (Beta Version)

This GitHub repository contains two Python scripts, each implementing an algorithm submitted for the [Datapef-Vision-Challenge (Beta Version)](https://www.dataperf.org/training-set-selection-vision). The challenge aims to solve problems related to computer vision and data-centric approaches.


## fpscv: Winning Approach

`fpscv.py` contains the code of the algorithm that won the  Datapef-Vision-Challenge (Beta Version).

## fps_nn: Alternative Solution

`fps_nn.py` contains an alternative solution to the challenge. While it did not secure the first position, it comes with certain advantages over the winning algorithm, such as the potential to select training sets that may be employed to train a model for a multi-class classification task  and not only for binary classification.

## Running the Scripts

To successfully run the Python scripts in this repository, you should execute them within the context of the [Datapef-Vision-Challenge GitHub repository](https://github.com/CoactiveAI/dataperf-vision-selection). This requirement is essential because the scripts depends on other shared resources within the challenge repository.
